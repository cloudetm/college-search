A tiny college search application.

Search by college name:

    http://$app-server:$port/$search_string
    http://some.host.org:45151/Portland

OR
    http://$app-name.domain.org/

NOTES: indexing over to a remote docker container required me increasing the requestTimeout (to 100 seconds from 30 seconds)
for the indexing to complete.
